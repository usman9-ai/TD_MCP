This directory contains application examples and configurations for the Teradata MCP Server. These examples demonstrate different ways to customize, configure, and build upon the server.

## Server Customization

### [`server-customisation/`](./server-customisation/)
**Configuration examples for customizing the Teradata MCP Server**

Customizing the Teradata MCP server is easy and doesn't require you to write a single line of code!

You will fine example configuration files that show how to:

- Create custom profiles with specific toolsets, database connections and communication settings
- Define custom tools, prompts, cubes, and glossary entries
- Set up domain-specific configurations (e.g., sales, DBA tools)
- Organize configurations for different use cases

Key files:
- `example_profiles.yml` - Custom profile configurations
- `example_custom_objects.yml` - Custom tools, prompts, and resources
- `sales_domain_example.yml` - Complete sales domain setup
- `dba_tools_example.yml` - Database administrator focused tools

Simply copy these files to your working directory, customize the content, and run the server from that directory.

### [`app-testing-agent/`](./app-testing-agent/)
**Testing prompts and configurations for MCP Server validation**

Contains specialized prompts and configurations designed build agents that can test the functionality of the MCP server. Useful for:
- Validating server setup and configuration
- Testing custom tools and prompts
- Quality assurance workflows

Run the server with: `teradata-mcp-server --profile tester`

## Client Applications
